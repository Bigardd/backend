The father of internet is vinct cerf
Internet was a result of another experiment called the arpanet(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)
Internet is evenly distributed not centralized
Information on the internet moves from one computer to another in the form of ethernet cables fibre, optic cables (i.e radio waves)
Information is made of bits
crypography is what keeps our information/communication secure on the internet 
Internet is a global network of interconnected computer that communicate using standardized protocol, primarily TCP/IP
Before we learn what internet is, network is a group of computer or other devices which are connected to each other.
Internet was developed in the late 1960's
The packet is then routed across various networks (using routers and switches) to the destination server, which processes the request and sends back the response. This back-and-forth exchange enables the transfer of data like web pages, emails, and files, making the internet a dynamic, decentralized system for global communication.
